                 PureBasic for Linux

               (c) Fantaisie Software

*****************************************************************

Installation:
-------------

  First, make sure you have the required libraries installed. (see README)
  On information where to download these packages and how to install them, 
  please refere to the documentation of your Linux distribution.

Language information:
  
  PureBasic help is provided in 3 langages (English, German and French).
  If the IDE language is set to one of these languages, it will choose
  the correct helpfile as well. 

  However, if you have selected a different language in the Preferences, 
  it will use the english helpfile by default. If you wish to change this, just
  replace the "english.help" in your purebasic folder by the one you wish to use.

  
Quick Installation method:

  If you do not need to use the compiler from the commandline, the quickest
  method is to simply extract the purebasic archive somewhere and execute
  the PureBasic IDE.

  Type "./purebasic" from inside the "compilers" folder, or doubleclick
  on the "purebasic" executable file in your file manager.


Other Installation methods:


  1) Recommended (doesn't require root rights)

     a) Setup the PUREBASIC_HOME environment variable to your purebasic
        path. It can be done in a terminal like this (if you have put 
        purebasic in your home directory):

  export PUREBASIC_HOME=~/purebasic


     b) Add the purebasic/compilers/ directory to you path, as it's
        where all purebasic binaries are. This can be done like this:

  export PATH=$PUREBASIC_HOME/compilers:$PATH


     After these 2 steps, you should be able to type 'pbcompiler' in a shell
     and you ready to use the IDE, just type 'purebasic'.

     Note that these steps only affect your current terminal session, and will not
     be present after you log out or restart. It is recommended that you put the above
     two lines inside a startup script (like "~/.bashrc" if you use the bash), so
     they are executed whenever you log in or open a terminal.
  
  
  2) Not recommended, as it will dispatch files at several place of your filessystem. It can be useful for large deployment tough.

  Use 'su -' to have root shell (if not already done)

  Copy the 'purebasic/Compilers/pbcompiler' file in /usr/bin/
  or any other directory in the PATH:

    # cp purebasic/compilers/pbcompiler /usr/bin/

  Next, move the whole 'purebasic' directory in /usr/share/

    # cp -rf purebasic /usr/share/

  If you don't have 'fasm', copy it in your path (fasm v1.45 at least)

    # cp purebasic/compilers/fasm /usr/bin/

  To test your install, just type:

    # pbcompiler

  It should output:
